# Implement a design with bootstrap

In this project, you will finalize the previous project 0x0B. Implement a design with bootstrap and make some parts dynamic with Javascript (JQuery exactly).

You will reuse final files of 0x0B. Implement a design with bootstrap and update them.

You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design/Bootstrap/Javascript knowledges that you learned previously.

You wonâ€™t have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple: Have fully functional web pages that look the same as the designer file.


## Requirements

- You have to use Bootstrap
- Your `styles.css` must be as small as you can - **you must use as much as you can Bootstrap classes**

- Web pages must switch to the tablet version when the screen width is 768px
- Web pages must switch to the mobile version when the screen width is 576px
- button hover/active: `opacity: 0.9`



## Final result
